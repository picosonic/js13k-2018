## Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE

![Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE](big_screenshot.png?raw=true "Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE")

Fred lives on planet Figadore in the Hercules cluster, he likes watching cat videos from planet Earth via _Parallax Shift_, but the network link has gone **OFFLINE**!

Help Fred by unlocking doors, solving puzzles and collecting cubes to pay for the entanglement repolarisation required to get his planet back online.

# Stuff I managed to add
* 2D platformer
* Full screen
* No canvas
* Works in various resolutions down to about 1366x768
* No 3rd party libraries
* All vector graphics (font bitmap rendered as vector)
* 8-bit tiny font (Repton inspired)
* Different coloured tiles per level
* Only div and span used for playfield
* CSS animations, some triggered by swapping element classes
* Simple timelines
* Retro terminal with typewriter effect
* Procedurally generated music (using frequency digraphs of Mario)
* Sound effects
* DTMF generator
* Gamepad support (for "standard" browser supported gamepads)
* Keyboard support for WASD, cursors and retro ZX;.
* Pseudo random generator inspired by BBC Micro

# Stuff I'd have done with more KBs
* More types of enemy
* Parallax scrolling backgrounds
* Better music (had to lower volume to make it more acceptable)
* Foliage or other scenery
* Support for going up stairs (this was almost working)
* Better enemy AI (more then just patrolling, perhaps jumping, line-of-sight wake up, e.t.c)
* More sound effects perhaps enhanced with envelopes
* Playfield scaling
* Better game completed screen
- [x] Animate the stars to twinkle
* Enemy squash and puzzle animations

# Tools used
* [Ubuntu OS](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
* [vim](https://github.com/vim) text editor (also [gedit](https://github.com/GNOME/gedit) a bit)
* [meld](https://github.com/GNOME/meld) visual diff/merge
* [Tiled](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled) map editor
* [Inkscape](https://github.com/inkscape/inkscape) SVG editor
* [GIMP](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp) image editor
* [Google closure compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home)
* [advzip](https://github.com/amadvance/advancecomp) (uses [7-Zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/) deflate to compress further)

I had help choosing the main character name and planet name from my 3yr old son.
Also I had help designing some levels and play testing from Jessica Vines.
